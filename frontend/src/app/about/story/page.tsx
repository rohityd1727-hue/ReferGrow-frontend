          ReferGrow is built around a simple idea: reward community growth using Business Volume (BV)
          so that every purchase can contribute to structured, level-wise income.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform is open to everyone. Users can join, purchase services, and build their network
          while the system tracks BV and distributes income along the upline.
