# Frontend -> Backend configuration
#
# The Next.js API proxy routes under /api/* forward requests to your backend.
# This base URL should point to the backend server (Express).
#
# Local default backend is usually:
#   http://localhost:4000
#
# Server-only (recommended)
BACKEND_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Public (exposed to the browser). Normally NOT needed because the browser
# uses same-origin calls to /api/*, but you can set it if you want.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
